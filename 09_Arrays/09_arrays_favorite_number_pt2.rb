=begin

In the code below, a nested array containing three groups 
of names and numbers is assigned to favorites.

Flatten and print this array. That is, the printed result 
should not have any subarrays, but should have all of the 
original strings and numbers from the original array:

Expected output:

["Dave", 7, "Miranda", 3, "Jason", 11]



=end

favorites = [['Dave', 7], ['Miranda', 3], ['Jason', 11]]
all_together = favorites.flatten

p all_together

=begin

MY ANSWER: 



SOLUTION:

flat_favorites = favorites.flatten

p flat_favorites

Discussion

Using Array#flatten is pretty straightforward. It returns 
a new array that is a one-dimensional flattening of the 
original array. In our solution, we assigned the new array 
to flat_favorites and printed it using #p. Lets try printing 
favorites, the original nested array:

flat_favorites = favorites.flatten

p flat_favorites # ["Dave", 7, "Miranda", 3, "Jason", 11]
p favorites      # [["Dave", 7], ["Miranda", 3], ["Jason", 11]]

That array doesn't look the same as flat_favorites. Why is that? 
There's actually two versions of the #flatten method. One with a 
bang suffix (!) and one without. Let's see what happens when we 
use #flatten! instead of #flatten:

flat_favorites = favorites.flatten!

p flat_favorites # ["Dave", 7, "Miranda", 3, "Jason", 11]
p favorites      # ["Dave", 7, "Miranda", 3, "Jason", 11]

They're both the same now. This is because #flatten! modifies 
the original array while #flatten only returns the modified 
version.
