=begin

In the code below, an array containing different types 
of pets is assigned to pets. Also, the return value of 
pets[2..3], which is ['fish', 'lizard'], is assigned to 
my_pets.

Remove 'lizard' from my_pets then print the value of 
my_pets.

Expected output:

I have a pet fish!

HINT: Array#pop is used to remove and return the last element 
of an array.
