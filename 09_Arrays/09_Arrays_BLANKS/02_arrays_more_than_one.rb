types of pets is assigned to pets.

from the pets array - select the two items at the 
e time. Assign the return value to a variable named 
my_pets, then print the contents of my_pets as a 
single string, e.g.:

I have a pet fish and a pet lizard!

Make sure you use my_pets to get the words "fish" and 
"lizard" in that message.
