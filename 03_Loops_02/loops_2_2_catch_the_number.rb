Modify the following code so that the loop stops if 
number is equal to or between 0 and 10.

=end

loop do
  number = rand(100)
  puts number
  
  break if number >= 0 && number <= 10 
end

MY ANSWER: 
Solution is simpler than my solution. 


SOLUTION:
loop do
  number = rand(100)
  puts number

  if number.between?(0, 10)
    break
  end
end

Discussion

Inside the loop, we're assigning a random integer 
to number upon each iteration. Our goal for this
exercise is to create a condition that stops the 
loop if number is equal to or between 0 and 10.

There are a couple ways we could have implemented 
this, however, we chose to use the 
Comparable#between? method. 

#between? takes two  
arguments and returns a boolean, true or false, 
if the caller's value is between the two integers 
provided. 

In this case, we use it in an if 
condition that will execute break when #between? 
returns true.
