Run the code as it is shown below, and take notice of any 
error messages.

Based on what the error messages are telling you, update 
the relevant method definitions and method invocations as 
necessary so that the names are printed as shown below.

Expected output:

The dog's name is Spot.
The cat's name is Ginger.

=end

def dog(name)
  return name
end

def cat(name)
  return name
end

puts "The dog's name is #{dog('Spot')}."
puts "The cat's name is #{cat('Ginger')}."

Discussion

When running the original code, you should have gotten 
an error called ArgumentError that looks like this:

wrong number of arguments (given 1, expected 0) (ArgumentError)


This error is telling you that dog passed in an argument 
when it was invoked. However, dog doesn't accept any
arguments. To fix this, we need to change dog so 
that it accepts one argument.

After fixing the error and running the code again, you 
should encounter the same type of error. It should look 
like this:

wrong number of arguments (given 0, expected 1) (ArgumentError)

This error is nearly identical to the first one, except 
it's reversed. Here, cat accepts one argument. However, 
no arguments were passed in when cat was invoked. To fix 
this, we need to add an argument when we invoke the method, 
like this: cat('Ginger').

When you're writing methods, it's important to keep track 
of how many arguments the method accepts and how many it's 
given upon invocation. Both numbers need to match or an
error will be thrown.
