Discussion

In previous exercises we've used #puts both inside and outside methods. 
When you use #puts inside a method, you're outputting one thing and 
returning another. #puts outputs whatever it's given and returns nil. 
In this case, we're printing the value inside the method, which means 
the method's return value is nil.

We can verify that #puts returns nil by using irb.

irb :001 > puts "Hello World!"
Hello World!
=> nil

The second line shows what was printed to the screen while the third 
line shows the return value. Looking at this, we can see that #puts 
outputs "Hello World!" and returns nil.
