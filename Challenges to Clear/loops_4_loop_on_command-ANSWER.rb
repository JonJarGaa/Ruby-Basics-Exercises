Discussion

This is a practical example of how a loop can be used to retrieve 
and handle user input. In the initial code, the loop continued 
iterating regardless of the input's value. To change that, we add 
break with an if condition. The condition, in this case, needs to 
be answer == 'yes'. This tells break to only execute if the input 
value is 'yes'.

We added a simple error message after break to demonstrate that 
break doesn't have to be at the end of the loop to do its job. 
  Also, providing an error message can be useful in providing a 
  better user experience when dealing with inputs.
