Create a nested hash using the following data.

Car
type 	color 	year
sedan 	blue 	2003

Truck
type 	color 	year
pickup 	red 	1998

=end

{
  car:   { type: 'sedan', color: 'blue', year: 2003 },
  truck: { type: 'pickup', color: 'red', year: 1998 }
}

p vehicles

=begin

MY ANSWER: 
Was not correcrt way to initialize a hash




SOLUTION:

{
  car:   { type: 'sedan', color: 'blue', year: 2003 },
  truck: { type: 'pickup', color: 'red', year: 1998 }
}

Discussion

Just as you can nest arrays, you can also nest hashes. 
Once you understand clearly how key-value pairs work, 
you'll realize that keys and values can be any form of 
object. In our solution, the value of :truck is:

{ type: 'pickup', color: 'red', year: 1998 }

The value is the entire hash even though the nested hash 
contains its own key-value pairs.
