Write a program that requests two integers from the user, 
adds them together, and then displays the result. Furthermore, 
insist that one of the integers be positive, and one negative; 
however, the order in which the two integers are entered does 
not matter.

Do not check for the positive/negative requirement until both 
integers are entered, and start over if the requirement is not 
met.

You may use the following method to validate input integers:

Examples:

$ ruby opposites.rb
>> Please enter a positive or negative integer:
8
>> Please enter a positive or negative integer:
0
>> Invalid input. Only non-zero integers are allowed.
>> Please enter a positive or negative integer:
-5
8 + -5 = 3

$ ruby opposites.rb
>> Please enter a positive or negative integer:
8
>> Please enter a positive or negative integer:
5
>> Sorry. One integer must be positive, one must be negative.
>> Please start over.
>> Please enter a positive or negative integer:
-7
>> Please enter a positive or negative integer:
5
-7 + 5 = -2

HINT: You can use a nested loop (a loop inside a loop) to solve this problem, but it may be easier to use a method to obtain both input integers.

def valid_number?(number_string)
  number_string.to_i.to_s == number_string && number_string.to_i != 0
end

loop do
  puts "Enter one positive and one negative number (in any order)"

  puts "Number 1: "
  num1 = gets.chomp
  puts "Number 2: "
  num2 = gets.chomp

  if valid_number?(num1) == false || valid_number?(num2) == false 
    puts "ERROR: Both must be numbers. TRY AGAIN"

  elsif num1.to_i.negative? && num2.to_i.negative? || num1.to_i.positive? && num2.to_i.positive?
    puts "ERROR: One number must be positive and one number must be negative. TRY AGAIN"

  elsif valid_number?(num1) && valid_number?(num2)
    num1 = num1.to_i
    num2 = num2.to_i
    puts "#{num1} + #{num2} = #{num1 + num2}"
    puts "MATH OPERATION COMPLETE!"
    break 
  else
    puts "ERROR UNKNOWN: TRY AGAIN"
  end

MY ANSWER: 



SOLUTION:

def valid_number?(number_string)
  number_string.to_i.to_s == number_string && number_string.to_i != 0
end

def read_number
  loop do
    puts '>> Please enter a positive or negative integer:'
    number = gets.chomp
    return number.to_i if valid_number?(number)
    puts '>> Invalid input. Only non-zero integers are allowed.'
  end
end

first_number = nil
second_number = nil

loop do
  first_number = read_number
  second_number = read_number
  break if first_number * second_number < 0
  puts '>> Sorry. One integer must be positive, one must be negative.'
  puts '>> Please start over.'
end

sum = first_number + second_number
puts "#{first_number} + #{second_number} = #{sum}"

Discussion

In this exercise we demonstrate how to handle multiple inputs that must be 
validated both independently and together; this is done by using a loop inside 
another loop (nested loops), but it is often easier to simply refactor the input 
loop into a separate method (or multiple methods if needed). We take this 
approach with our solution.

Of course, we use the provided valid_number? method for validation. This differs 
from the valid_number? we used previously in that it also treats 0 as an invalid 
entry.

Next, we have a read_number method that we use for our standard get-some-input 
pattern. The main difference here is that we return from the method instead of 
using break to exit the loop. (You can also use break number.to_i, but since we 
really want to return instead, we use return.)

We then initialize our two input variables, then start a loop that reads each of 
the 2 numbers, then exits if their product is negative, or issues an error message 
and repeats the loop if the product is positive. Note that the product is negative 
if and only if one number is positive, the other negative, so this satisfies our 
requirement that one number be positive, the other negative.

Finally, we add the two numbers together and print the result.
